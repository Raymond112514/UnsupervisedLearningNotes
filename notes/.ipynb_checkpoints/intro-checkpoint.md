# Notes on Deep Unsupervised Learning

These are my notes on deep unsupervised learning, where I have implemented several classic generative models. My notes are primarily based on the Berkeley CS298-154 Deep Unsupervised Learning course and Tomczak's book on Deep Generative Modeling. Currently, I have covered five classes of generative models:

* Autoregressive models
* Flow based models
* Variational autoencoders
* Generative adversarial networks
* Diffusion models

The write-ups for each section are still in progress, and I'm currently adding semisupervised learning method.
