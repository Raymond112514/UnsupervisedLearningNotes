    "Suppose that the data $\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2,..., x_D]$ lies in $D$ dimensional space. Usually the joint distribution $p(x_1, x_2,..., x_D)$ is too complex to model. For example, if $x_i$ only takes two values, $0$ and $1$, then modeling $p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ requires $2^4 = 16$ parameters. However, for binary images of shape $28 \\times 28$, we would need $2^{28^2} \\approx 10^{236}$ parameters! To address this, we can decompose the joint distribution into simpler conditional distributions. In particular, if there is a Bayes net structure on the variables, we can exploit this and decompose the distribution as\n",
